Issues





What I learned from this Assignment

Throughout this project, I've developed significant technical skills and enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively. As I explored REST APIs further, I improved my ability to document and test software thoroughly, using tools like pytest. Addressing specific challenges gave me practical experience in solving real-world issues, though it was sometimes frustrating, particularly during complex debugging sessions. Collaborating with others to overcome these obstacles not only eased some of the frustration but also deepened my understanding of the system's complexities. This project has been instrumental in advancing my technical knowledge and in dissecting the intricate processes involved in API development and software testing. The expertise I've gained is crucial for my career growth and lays a solid groundwork for my future projects.
